Explain what a Hashmap is, also some collision handling methods  
Hashmap is working with key and value that can have a null.
Hashmap is not synchronized.
A Key must have a unique value, but a value can have a duplicated value.
Time complexity is O(1), but the worst case is O(n),
and it depends on distributing data in a hash table.

insert, delete -> linked list
search -> array

	key

  hash method
(hash function)
 	  |
  hash code ————— bucket 0 (  entries )
				      bucket 1 (  entries )
				      bucket 2 (  entries )

Getting key and putting it in hash method to get hash code.
and a hash code uses as an index of bucket in hash table.

Collision happens where a newly inserted key maps
to an already occupied slot in the hash table is called collision.

The collision happens when multiple keys hash to the same bucket.
one way to avoid collision is making hash table size as a prime number.
To resolve conflict, there are Open Address and Separate Chaining method.
1. Open Addressing
In this technique, if in case say two keys generate same hash,
the first one would be stored at the hash position,
and the other one(s) would be stored at next best position.
Linear Probing - Simply look for the next empty space in the array.
The worst case is point comes back to the starting point of searching,
and searching is the end. Simply look for the next empty space in the array.
The worst case is point comes back to the starting point of searching and searching end.
Cache efficiency is good but there is data of clustering.
Double hashing probing - one hash value as an index into the table and then
repeatedly steps forward an interval until the desired value is located,
an empty location is reached, or the entire table has been searched
A popular second hash function is : hash2(key) = PRIME – (key % PRIME)
where PRIME is a prime smaller than the TABLE_SIZE.
2. Separate Chaining
LinkedList - The idea is to make each cell of the hash table point to
a linked list of records that have the same hash method value.
3. Resize
If the number of used buckets is more than 75%, resizing the number of buckets.

what is hash table?
HashTable is a collection of key-value pairs that distribute entries evenly across an array.
The index to put an entry is decided by the hash function.
If the data size is too big for the array, a collision may happen that two entries share the same hashcode/index.
To keep both entries in the index, create a list(double linked list)
for each index to store all entries with the same hashcode.
Average search/delete/insert takes O(1) on average (usually, the linked lists are in constant size).
Worst-case time complexity can be linear if all entries crowd into the same list,
and it takes a linear search to find.
